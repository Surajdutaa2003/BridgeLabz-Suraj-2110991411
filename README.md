# Datastructures Repository

Welcome to the **Datastructures** repository! This repository is organized to help you understand and implement various data structures and algorithms. It consists of a dedicated branch named `Datastructures` containing two folders: `array` and `stacks`.

---

## Branch Overview: `Datastructures`

This branch is specifically created for learning and implementing basic data structures and algorithms. Below is the structure of the branch:


### Folder 1: `array`

This folder contains implementations of array methods and sorting algorithms. Each file is modular to make understanding and testing easier:

1. **`array_methods.js`**
   - Common array operations like searching, updating, and traversing.

2. **`bubble_sort.js`**
   - Implementation of Bubble Sort algorithm.

3. **`insertion_sort.js`**
   - Implementation of Insertion Sort algorithm.

4. **`selection_sort.js`**
   - Implementation of Selection Sort algorithm.

### Folder 2: `stacks`

This folder focuses on stack data structures and provides two different implementations:

1. **`stack_implementation.js`**
   - Basic implementation of a stack using arrays.

2. **`extended_stack.js`**
   - Stack implementation by extending the functionality of the `array` class, showcasing inheritance and code reuse.
